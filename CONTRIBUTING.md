# Contributing to Alchemize Planets

Welcome to an Alchemize project. Alchemize Planets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Free GitHub account
- A Free Linear Account
- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub

### Example of A Contributors Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository** -> [How To](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
    - **Why**: Forking creates a personal copy of the project in your GitHub account. This allows you to experiment and make changes without affecting the original repository.

2. **Clone Your Fork** -> [How To](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    - **Why**: Cloning brings a copy of your forked repository onto your local machine. This enables you to work on the project files directly from your own computer.

3. **Set Up the Development Environment**
    - **Why**: Setting up your development environment ensures that you have all the necessary tools and dependencies to run and contribute to the project effectively. It helps in maintaining consistency across different contributors.

4. **Browse the Linear Issues and Assign What You Want To Work On**
    - **Why**: This step helps you find tasks that are suitable for your skills and interests. It also prevents duplication of work as you can see what others are working on.

5. **Start Coding Your Solution**
    - **Why**: This is where you apply your skills to solve a specific problem or add new features to the project. It's the core part of contributing to an open source project.

6. **Commit Your Changes**
    - **Why**: Committing changes saves your modifications to your local repository. Each commit acts as a checkpoint, meaning if something goes wrong, you can revert to a previous commit.

7. **Push Your Commits To Your Fork** -> [How To](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository)
    - **Why**: Pushing your commits to your fork on GitHub updates your remote repository with the changes you made locally. This keeps your online fork synchronized with your local work.

8. **Submit Your Pull Request**
    - **Why**: A pull request is how you propose your changes to the original project. It allows the maintainers to review your contributions and discuss potential improvements before integrating them into the main project.

### Working On Linear Issues

All of our contributions start inside of Linear. Linear is a project management tool that breaks projects down into bite size chunks called "Issues" 

Once you are inside of the Linear project 'Alchemize Planets" follow the steps below to get started:

1. Look for open issues on our [Linear board](LINK_TO_LINEAR_BOARD).
2. Assign any issue that interests you to yourself so others know you are working on it.
3. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it.
4. Follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

### Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Improvements/Features

- Use the [Issues tab](LINK_TO_GITHUB_ISSUES) inside of the github project to report a bug or suggest new features.
- If approved the reported bug or suggestion will be turned into a Linear Issue that can be assigned and completed.
- Before creating an issue, check if it already exists.
- Clearly describe the issue or suggestion, providing all necessary details. 

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Go to the `Pull Requests` tab and click `New pull request`.
2. Select your branch and describe your changes.
3. Submit the pull request, linking the relevant issue.
